### About

This project covers the creation of a dummy text generator app, similar to the many "Lorem Ipsum" applications used by developers as placeholder text for their projects. Utilizing the power of React and the Bacon Ipsum API (https://baconipsum.com/json-api/), we create our very own UI that lets the user select how many paragraphs of text they'd like, then with the click of a button, generate text for them to use in their projects.
